          <!-- <p>I love challenges and learning new things, which is one of the reasons I enjoy my job as a front-end engineer so much. The
            technology is constantly changing and with new technologies emerging all the time. Whether it's figuring out a new
            technique with flexbox, exploring the possibilities of using SVGs and canvas, or venturing into the server
            side with Node.js, there's always opportunity to try something new. It’s an exciting industry to be part of.
          </p> -->
          <p>I love learning new things and finding creative solutions to difficult challenges. With interests spanning
            technology, mathmatics, psychology, design, and more, I have found a career as a front-end engineer has
            allowed me to satisfy my desire to work with logic and provided an outlet for creativity, while still
            maintaining a connection with the human element.</p>
          <p>After graduating from Baylor University in 2008 with a BA in Philosophy I spent a few years working in the
            restaurant industry where I worked my way up to a management role. Balancing inventory, food and labor
            costs, and leading teams of cooks, servers, and support staff through busy shifts was fun and exciting work.
            I really value the leadership experience I gained during that time. But, eventually it became clear that I
            needed a change to achieve the life I wanted.</p>
          <p>After some careful consideration about my goals, I decided to go back to school and enrolled in Texas State
            Technical College to earn a degree in Web Development. It was here that I developed a passion for
            programming. The idea of having a career in which I was able to build things using problem solving skills
            and logic was perfect.</p>
          <p>I was able to land an internship at a marketing agency called Marketing Matters, where I quickly was
            selected for full time employment as a Jr Web Developer. Marketing Matters catered to clients all the way
            from a local to an international level. My work there included the support of existing sites, coding for
            email marketing campaigns, devising SEO strategies, managing Adword campaigns, and building websites from
            start to finish. As part of a small interactive team, I had a big part in the technical aspects of helping
            our clients build their digital footprint.</p>
          <p>The knowledge and experience I gained at Marketing Matters eventually led me to a job at Kasasa (then
            called BancVue), building and maintaining websites for small financial institutions across the nation. This
            was a whole new level of production for me; I was now collaborating closely with an operations team of more
            than 40 professionals focused on providing a world-class product with ever-shrinking timelines. Though
            difficult at first, that environment pushed me to learn diligence and focus in coding, and to apply the best
            practices that are required when working on a team of developers.</p>
          <p>My time with Kasasa prepared me for my next career move and current role of senior software engineer at
            CommScope. Here I build applications for telecom companies such as AT&T; Applications used to monitor and
            maintain networks ranging from single subscriber homes to nation wide infrastructure. In addition to writing
            code my responsibilities include mentoring other software engineers, updating technical documentation,
            working through product testing with QA, communicating with Product Services to understand client needs,
            helping Product Services integrate software updates, working closely with back-end engineers to define API
            requirements, and collaborating with UX/UI designers to develop UIs that focus on user needs. As a senior
            software engineer at CommScope I really enjoy the level of involvement I have thoughout the software
            development life cycle.</p>

          <!-- <p>My time with Kasasa has given me a real sense of project scope and how to deliver clients' needs while
            achieving company goals. I was also able to work on side projects outside of my normal job duties, providing
            technical solutions for special client needs, and experimenting with new technologies with the goal of
            improving our productsl value. I've especially enjoyed getting my hands dirty with the latest technologies
            for server side JavaScript and would really like to see my career move in that direction.</p> -->
